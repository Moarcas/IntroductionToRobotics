  Homework 1 - RGB LED
  </summary>
  
  ## RGB LED with 3 potentiometers
  ### Components:
  * 1 RGB LED
  * 3 potentiometers
  * 1 resistor and wires as needed
  ### Technical Task:
  * Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.
