    Homework 1 - RGB LED
  </summary>
Requirement:
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)
of an RGB LED using individual potentiometers. By the end of this task,
you will gain experience in interfacing potentiometers with the Arduino and
controlling RGB LEDs based on the analog readings.
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red,
Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a
mapped value to the LED pins.
